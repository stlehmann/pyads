Welcome to pyads's documentation!
=================================

This is a Python wrapper for TwinCATs ADS library. It aims to provide a
pythonic way to communicate with TwinCAT devices by using the Python 
programming language. pyads uses the C API provided by *TcAdsDll.dll* on 
Windows and *adslib.so* on Linux. The Linux library is included in this
package.

The documentation for the ADS API is available on `infosys.beckhoff.com`_.
